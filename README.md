# Project Argus

> A modular AI runtime for orchestrating intelligent agents, tools, memory, and multiple language model providers.

**Current Version:** v0.4.0-dev
---

**Status:** 🚧 Active Development

**Current Milestone:** Brick #4 – Argus Engine

**Latest Achievement:** Provider-agnostic architecture with local and cloud LLM support.


---

# Vision

Project Argus is an open-source AI runtime focused on building reliable, maintainable, and extensible AI systems.

Rather than being a single chatbot, Argus is designed to become an operating system for AI—capable of coordinating specialized agents, interacting with external services, executing complex workflows, and seamlessly switching between local and cloud language models.

The project is being built from the ground up using production-quality software engineering practices with an emphasis on modular architecture, readability, testing, maintainability, and long-term extensibility.

# Development Philosophy

Project Argus is being built as if it were a production software platform rather than a prototype.

Every major feature follows the same development process:

1. Design
2. Implementation
3. Testing
4. Documentation
5. Git versioning
6. Development journal updates

The goal is not simply to build an AI application, but to engineer a maintainable platform that can continue to grow over time.
